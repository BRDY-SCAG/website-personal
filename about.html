            This page is for getting to know my journey. I was born in Gallup, New Mexico to begin.
            Gallup is a small town, I didn't stay there long because I moved to Albquerque, New Mexico when 
            I was around 4 years old. My favorite color is green and I've always been intrigued by the arts and sciences in life. 
            I love painting with oil paint even though i'm not particullarly good at any of it. I like taking pictures of places I've never been 
            to capture the moment. I really enjoy numbers and sequences of numbers I remember being shown the fibonacci sequence in 3rd grade and 
            that "spiraled" my interest in mathematics and eventaully computers. In highschool I played baseball for all 4 years which tought me alot about 
            teamwork and the environments teams create. To save the best for last I am a dog lover and have two pretty pups (Creed and Frankie). Creeds a new addition 
            and he loves his sister.
